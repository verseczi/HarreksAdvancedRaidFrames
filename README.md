## Introduction
Advanced Raid Frames works with default and addon frames to improve functionality, offering features like buff tracking customization. This is intended to work with your favorite frame addons, integrating and leaving as small of a footprint as possible so you can enjoy the look of your preferred frames with the advanced options Advanced Raid Frames offers. If you have feature requests, bug reports, or any questions, please use come to the [SpiritbloomPro discord](https://discord.gg/MMjNrUTxQe) and leave a message.

## Functionality

- Advanced Buff Tracking: Selectively track buffs in several ways and reposition those buff icons on your party/raid frames. Buff tracking is very good but not perfect and is actively being worked on as bugs are found.
- Click-through Aura Icons: Removes mouse interaction from most elements on the default frames, letting targeting work through them and removing the tooltips.
- Frame Transparency: Disables transparency effects on the default frames so they remain 100% solid when units are out of range.
- Name Size and Color: Scale player names and color them according to class colors.
- Spotlight: Move the raid frames of selected units into a separate group with any position of your choice.

## Planned Upgrades

- Overshields: Show shields that go above the unit's max health on the default frames.
- Spotlight Groupings: Separate the spotlight in several rows or columns.
- Integrate the tracking into more frame addons
- Aura Spotlight: Track specific auras on specific units in a more clear way (think mini-weakauras for your own buffs)
